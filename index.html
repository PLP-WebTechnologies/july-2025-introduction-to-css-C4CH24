        <h1>Understanding the CSS Box Model</h1>
        <p>
            The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept for designing web pages. It dictates how elements are rendered on a page, and it's essential for controlling layout and spacing. Every element is treated as a rectangular box with four key components: "content", "padding", "border", and "margin".
        </p>

        <h2>The Four Parts of the Box</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>content</strong> area is where your text, images, or other media reside. The <strong>padding</strong> is the space between the content and the border. The <strong>border</strong> is a line that goes around the padding and content. Finally, the <strong>margin</strong> is the clear space outside the border that separates the element from other elements on the page.
        </p>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Visualizing the Box Model</h3>
            <p>
                This card element is a perfect example of the box model in action. The light gray background shows the content and padding area. The solid gray line is the border, and the clear space around this entire card (from the other paragraphs) is the margin.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            By adjusting these values, you can create precise and consistent layouts. In this example, we've used padding to give our button some internal space and margin to create separation between our main content sections.
